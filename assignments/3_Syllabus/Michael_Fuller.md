Immigrants and Multicultural Society

AP Social Studies


'How do you identify as an immigrant and what does it mean to live in a multicultural society'

I am a first-generation Canadian citizen of immigrant parents but never really thought of or identified myself that way. My mother emigrated from Poland at a young age with her eight brothers and sisters and landed in Toronto Canada. Bringing as much of her cultural heritage with her as she could, including a sliver menorah, one of a few artifact that they took with them, and eventually raising a family there. I grew up in a culturally diverse downtown Toronto up until half way through the middle of middle school when we then moved to a less diverse north Toronto suburb where I lived till moving out around eighteen. 
In my early thirties I emigrated to New York with my wife and one child, a little less cultural heritage than my mother but included the menorah that my mother gave me. Three of my four children are first generation United states citizens. I still don't identify myself as coming from an immigrant family nor that I am an immigrant from another country, but I do identify with my heritage.

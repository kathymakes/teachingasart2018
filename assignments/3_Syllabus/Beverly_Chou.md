## Overview
This class will be an exploration on the ways on which our lives are influenced by patterns. There are many lenses to experience patterns - mathematical, visual, artistic, behavioral, musical, structural, scientific, etc. Students will examine why patterns come into existence, how they might be influenced, and what that means in the context of our lives. As a part of the larger curriculum, students will engage with both their fellow students as well as local members of the community.

### Assignments
For assignments students will delve more deeply specific topics of their choosing. All homework assignments have a short writing component (< 1 page), but students should convey their ideas in mediums relevant to the topic they are exploring.



## Weekly Schedule


### Week 1: Observing patterns
* *(20 min)*  Lecture on examples of patterns observed in the world.
* *(20 min)*   Out of class activity - Observe as many patterns as possible without leaving school premises.
* *(20 min)*  Debrief and group discussion on observations.
* **Homework:** Describe 3 patterns that youâ€™ve observed or researched.


### Week 2:  Understanding patterns
* *(15 min)*  Discuss and attempt to catalog patterns from homework.
* *(20 min)*  Lecture on ways we try to quantify patterns and common connections between patterns.
* *(25 min)*  In class activity - draw connections between patterns cataloged by the class.
* **Homework:** Choose 1-2 patterns that fascinate you and attempt to explain why they exist.


### Week 3: Making Patterns
* *(15 min)*  Discuss homework and share fascinating finds.
* *(25 min)*  Break into groups and spread out. Students will create their own patterns and document them to explains its purpose and how other people can recreate it.
* *(20 min)*  Students will present their patterns to each other, attempt to teach their pattern to another group, make discussion, and critique.
* **Homework:** Find a member of the community and interview them on patterns in their lives.


### Week 4: Breaking Patterns
* *(15 min)*  Discuss homework and share interesting discoveries.
* *(25 min)*  Lecture on examples of when pattern breaks - include historical, scientific, behavioral examples especially. Discuss how/why some patterns might be robust or more easily broken.
* *(20 min)*  Teacher brings in an outside community member to talk about pattern breaking in their life. Discussion and questions.
* **Homework:** Find an example of when patterns break or have exceptions. Explain how it has an effect outside of itself.


### Week 5: Communicating Patterns
* *(10 min)*  Wrap up the class and present best practices for giving presentations.
* *(30 min)*  Work in groups to create 3-5 minute presentations on anything relating to patterns. Students must draw and convey their conclusions beyond describing information.
* *(20 min)*  Students give their presentations and give each other feedback.

My workshop is loosely inspired by [Lygia Clark](http://art-breath.com/lygia-clark/); I’m drawn to the way she frames art as a lived therapy, a healing process, a way of engaging with your entire body, and with others.

## on healing, on bomb scars
This workshop is inspired by [The Opposites Game](http://www.theamericanjournalofpoetry.com/v2-constantine.html), a poem by Brendan Constantine.

(I have loved this poem since the fall)

To me, this workshop is about healing. It will be 60 minutes, held indoors, at Brooklyn Botanical Garden Palm House. 
Indoors enough to be warm, but in a space where you can see the trees.

The premise of the workshop is to create an object which is “the opposite of a gun,” 
and then to give it away to someone else in the class. It also includes smaller activities.

### some images — 10 minutes

### get to know each other — 10 minutes

  * I will prepare some bread to share.
  * What is a memorable gift that someone has given you?

### verbs warm-up, activity —15 minutes 

  *  ***Note*** I’m not sure if we’ll have time for this. But it seems fun. 
  * As a class, brainstorm a list of verbs you can do to a single piece of paper. Try to create a pretty exhaustive list as a class. 
  * Perform the verbs as if it were a ritual. Maybe close your eyes, listen to the paper. 
  Tear, fold, bite, sculpt, draw, share, etc. 
  * Reflection: How did that feel for you? What was difficult?  

### the opposite of a gun, activity — 35 minutes 

  * List out the antonyms to Emily Dickenson’s famous line, “My Life Had Stood a Loaded Gun.”

  * What does the opposite of a gun do? What powers does it have?
  * Using found materials (sticks, leaves, stones, strings, essential oils, paper), build the opposite of a gun. 
  * Reflection: what did you make? How did you feel about the process?

### to wrap up: 

  * Give your anti-gun to a member of the class. 
  * Read Brendan Constantine’s poem aloud to the class.

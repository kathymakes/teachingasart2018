CLOUD POEMS AND INCOMPLETE THEOREMS

(Elective - 6 weeks - 2 credits)




 Cumulus
 
“Still soaring, as if some celestial call
Impell’d it to yon heaven’s sublimest hall;
High as the clouds, in pomp and power arrayed,
Enshrined in strength, in majesty displayed;
All the soul’s secret thoughts it seems to move,
Beneath it trembles, while it frowns above.”
Goethe

DESCRIPTION

Johann Wolfgang von Goethe was one of the most celebrated intellectuals of the 19th century, as a writer 
he was a bursting talent and a jewel for his country, but Goethe’s prose not only flourished in his novels 
but in his scientific work. He wrote poems to the clouds, to the plants, to  the forms of nature. In this 
class, students will learn about the history of different branches of science, their the impact or interweaving with the art, society and culture. We’ll discuss and elaborate around the contributions of 
biologist, mathematicians, composers and even actors. Readings, sketching, experimentation and in class 
lectures will give place to projects, the crazier the better. 

MATERIALS

Readings will be provided to the student. A sketchbook is mandatory for all students of this class. 

ATTENDANCE

You are expected to attend all the sessions, if for medical or personal reasons you are unable to attend

ASSIGMENTS AND PROJECTS

Two sketchbook entries (illustrations, poem, doodling, etc) per week.

200 to 250 words response to the readings and class

One 5-1o minutes presentation about a topic/scientist/artist you want and is relevant under the context of 
the class. Two per session.

One “all” students project (given by the instructor)

One final project has no requirements, it can be an experiment, a compilation of poems, even a painting. 
Just remember this is a final project and as such it must demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of

for peer review.

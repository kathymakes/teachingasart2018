**Course Name:**  Making: Mistakes and Evolutions

**Course Description:**  This is an elective ‘art’ class designed for students with varying interests to explore a medium of their choosing.  This is an advanced class that assumes an introductory course in the desired medium has already been completed by the student. 

Through making, we will explore the science, mathematics, design, construction, and overall process behind creating.  Students will work independently yet collectively to employ common approaches to their unique projects.  The instructor will work alongside the students, providing an example of a topic of his/her choosing.  Each week students will present on their work from the previous week, culminating in a final presentation on his/her experience in completing a 5-week project of their choice.

**Week 1:  Choosing a topic**
	
	Discussion on mediums with examples from past students
	Sizing a project
	Reference building
	Research approach
	Documentation methodology
	
**Class Activity:**  Students will pair up to discuss their project ideas and will collectively create something out of clay that represents their combined interests.  

**Homework Assignment:**  Choose a project topic and write a 1 page document including why this project interests you, what you hope to gain from this experience, who/what are your inspirations, and what challenges you might face. 

**Week 2:  Designing a project**
	
	Sustainably making
	Dieter Rams’ 10 principles for Good Design
	Design references
	Project modularity
	Sourcing materials/BOM

**Class Activity:** Students will present on their project concept and homework from week 1.

**Homework Assignment:**  Hash out the details of your project.  Create a timeline for your project and research the associated materials you will need and where you will obtain them.  Can you find any of what you need second hand?  For free?  Where do these materials come from and how are they produced?  Create a Bill of Materials and write a one page document discussing the impact of using them.  Be prepared to present the above for receiving approval to move forward and purchasing any required goods. 

**Week 3:  Makers best practices**

	Tool safety
	Respecting your workspace (and workmates)
	Prototyping
	Iteration

**Class activity:**  Students will be paired up with each duo receiving an article on a different artistic practice highlighting the history, evolution of process, and key contributors to the artform.  Each pair will present for 5 minutes, recapping what they have learned.

**Homework assignment:**  Create a 30 minute prototype of your design out of a cheap and readily available medium, documenting your process through notes, drawings, photos, etc. Write about your experience focusing on:  What did you learn?  What will you do differently in the weeks to come?  How has your design changed based on this?  Update your BOM and submit it to the instructor who will purchase your revised list of materials.
	
**Week 4:  Project assembly**

	Testing
	Troubleshooting
	Recycling

**Class activity:**  This class will be lecture based with the instructor showcasing their own procedures in working on his/her own project.   

**Homework:**  Make the first iteration of your project.  Test it and document the shortcomings of this version and how your final piece will evolve before the final class.  

**Week 5:  Working session**

Students will work independently on their projects with available aid from the instructor and other students who are using similar toolsets.  

**Homework:**  Complete your project - It doesn’t have to be perfect.  Prepare a 10-12 minute presentation on all of the steps you’ve gone through to arrive at this point.  What was easy?  What was difficult?  Which piece took up the most of your time?  Who helped you?  Include your final BOM and step by step instructions for another student who might take on a similar project. 

**Week 6:  Final presentations**

	Lecture on the evolution of ideas
	Innovators who failed
	Final student presentations

**Homework:**  Continue to explore and evolve your ideas.

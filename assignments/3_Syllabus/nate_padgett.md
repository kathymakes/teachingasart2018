## Synopsis 

In this cross-disciplinary course touching on all three of our academic verticals, students will explore systems they encounter every day. From water to the origins of the weekend, we will spend 6 weeks exploring what most people take for granted. 

After completing this class, students will have a deeper appreciation for and understanding of key systems that impact their daily lives. Students will develop intellectual tools for challenging conventional wisdom and thinking critically about these systems. We will also learn how to user an online tool called GitHub for submitting homework assignments and preparing for weekly-in class discussions. GitHub is a website primarily used for sharing and working on creative, personal, and professional computer coding projects. It is also a great document management tool that is a pre-requisite for many of our science and arts courses, and may prove valuable for future creative and professional pursuits.

Classes will begin with a discussion of the previous week’s theme and homework, followed by a lecture and discussion. We’ll save the remaining time in class for discussing the homework assignment that will be due the following week. 

## Assignments 

Students will be assigned weekly readings and videos related to that week's lecture topic. In addition to these readings, students must write a 500 word reflection on each week’s topic with at least three questions for discussion in the following week’s class. Reflections and questions must be posted to the class blog hosted on GitHub by 12pm every Sunday.

The class will have one midterm and one final assignment. For the midterm, students will write a 5,000 word essay about a research topic they will be assigned on the first day of class. For their final projects, students will research and prepare 7 minute presentations on a research topic of their choosing.

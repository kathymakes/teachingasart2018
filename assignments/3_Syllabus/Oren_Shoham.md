# "Community Kitchen" Syllabus

## Course Description

This course teaches students how to cook for themselves and for their fellow students. In this class, you will learn basic cooking techniques and will gain hands-on experience in the kitchen. This class assumes no prior culinary skills or knowledge.

Class time will be split between lectures and in-kitchen demonstrations of cooking techniques and basic recipes. The ratio of lecture time to in-class activities will vary by week.

Additionally, Students will be divided into three groups (depending on class size), each of which will have to prepare a meal for the rest of the class once during the semester.

Class size will be limited to no more than 20 students per section.

If you have an allergy or dietary restriction, please let me know as soon as possible so that I can accommodate your needs.

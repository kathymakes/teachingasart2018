*This workshop will explore Lygia Clarkâ€™s notions of self awareness, collaboration, and sense, inviting participants to create a common project based on independent ideals.*   

**Preparation:**

Participants will be led through a 20-25 minute meditation session to put participants at ease.  Upon finishing, pairs will be formed; Each pair will consist of 1) a speaker and 2) a constructor.  

The 'constructor' group will be presented with a construction 'kit', consisting of the following: 
Paper - cut to different shapes and in different colors, scissors, and paperclips.

**Exercise:**

Participants will then be instructed to familiarize themselves with the assorted materials for two minutes.  Participant groups will then create a collective model designed to realize their own personal sanctuary (home).  

Each speaker will spend 10 minutes with their eyes closed, describing their own personal idea of a comfortable, safe space.  In silence, the constructor of the pair will interpret the speakers vision and build that space out of the materials provided. At the end of the 10 minutes, the speaker will open their eyes and reinterpret the sculpture based on their own recount of what they had described.

The workshop will commence with a broader discussion on Clark's 'Bichos' series, and the notion of interactive interpretive  sculpture.  

**Goals:**

This workshop aims to create a therapeutic experience for both members of the pair.  The speaker will dig to identify their ideal space, representative of their own body, while isolated to their own mind.  The manual manipulation by the constructor will also serve as a fluid exercise creating empathy with the speaker.  The reinterpretation by the speaker at the end serves to solidify the bond between the two.  The end series of class-constructed 'Bichos' will be put on display to be interpreted and re-defined by spectators to come.

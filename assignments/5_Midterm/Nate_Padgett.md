## Synopsis

**Duration:** 1 hour

**Participants:** 10

This workshop explores art and sculpture as social actions capable of creating change and building community.

By the end of this workshop, participants will have a deeper understanding of the social implications of art and Joseph Beuys’ idea of Social Sculpture. Beuys believed that everyone is an artist and that life itself is a work of art. His work often revolved around the central thesis that through art we can reshape society. The objective of this workshop is to explore this transformative idea and how we as an engaged public of artists can realize it. 

The majority of the workshop will be spent collectively developing a "Social Sculpture” about gun violence. Together we will exam this issue through the lens of art and communication, building a “wall of hope”, an array of written statements and drawings depicting potential solutions to the problem of gun violence in the United States. 

Please be punctual as this workshop is only an hour long. Participants will have a 5 minute grace period to arrive and get settled into our “classroom” at the [Five Myles](http://www.fivemyles.org/) gallery in Crown Heights before we begin.

Before the workshop, please take a few minutes to read about Joseph Beuys and his work. The following readings are recommended as preparation:

## Schedule

**5 minutes** 

Participants arrive at Five Myles and familiarize themselves with the space and the other participants. 

**10 minutes**

Ring discussion (Ringgesprache) about Joseph Beuys, art as activism, and Social Sculpture. 

**5 minutes**

Introduction to the social sculpture we will be developing. We will be building a “Wall of Hope”, which will consist of concise, written statements and drawings. Statements can be quotes (ie: “Ideas pull the trigger, but instinct loads the gun”, by Don Marquis) or written thoughts.

**25 minutes**

Build time. The workshop leader will provide paper, pens, and markers for the participants to use. Each participant will create at least three works, one of which should be a drawing. 

**15 minutes**

Present and display work. Each participant will have a minutes to explain their work to the group and it’s place in the larger context of the Social Sculpture. After each participant has explained their work, we will mount the works on a wall in Five Myles' [Plusspace](http://www.fivemyles.org/programs-1/) for visitors to view. 

Here’s an example of what the wall will (hopefully) look like:

## Radical DIY Reality

A workshop inspired by the work of Joseph Beuys, in particular his relationship to personal mythology, symbolism and ritual.

This workshop will introduce students to a range of tools for temporary and subjective reality creation.

Looking to state-of-the-art techniques under development in Chaos magick, we will discuss belief technology and cybernetics.

The workshop will culminate in a sigil design and activation performance.


### Introduction to Chaos Magick

Introduction to the concept of Magick and Sigils.

Key points:
* Magick as an artistic process
* Magick as a means to move beyond the familiar and the rigid
* Magick not as enlightenment or objective truth finding
* Sigil as a practical introduction to magical thinking


_"On a bargain basement level, Chaos Magic lives in the same realm as the cult of positive thinking. But it goes beyond making mood boards of highend apartments you’d like to will into your possession. Belief becomes a technology that creates change..._

_Mixing your own Kool-Aid, deciding how strong to make it, knowing when to drink it and when to stop, is Chaos Magic in practice. It’s radical DIY that uses reality as the only necessary operating system. This is not to say that Kool-Aid will always take you on the path you intended. Drink too much and you might end up lost, alone, or dead."_ </br>

### Corporate magick and Viral Sigils

Consider the relationship between Chaos Magick and Corporate branding. Branding is about implanting ideas in the brains of an audience, Chaos Magic is about implanting ideas in your own.

Key points:
* Both practices depend on creation of sigils and mantras
* Sigil = Logo
* Mantra = Slogan

### Hypersigils and Performance Art

Key Points:
* Hypersigil as sigil beyond the static image
* Hypersigil incorporates characterization, drama and plot

_"The 'hypersigil' or 'supersigil' develops the sigil concept beyond the static image and incorporates elements such as characterization, drama, and plot. The hypersigil is a sigil extended through the fourth dimension. My own comic book series The Invisibles was a six-year long sigil in the form of an occult adventure story which consumed and recreated my life during the period of its composition and execution. The hypersigil is an immensely powerful and sometimes dangerous method for actually altering reality in accordance with intent. Results can be remarkable and shocking"_</br>
_(Grant Morrison, Pop Magic, 2014)_

### Hypersigils and Cybernetics

How might the hypersigil apply to the concept of internet and cybernetics?

Key Points:
* Choices we make defining online personas. eg. Facebook profiles
* How online persona can manifest change in offline world
* How things we choose to place on the internet reflect and magnify awareness of ourselves

### Sigil creation workshop

Basic steps for Sigil creation:

_Note that the prescriptive nature of the process described here is to provide an accessible entry point into magical thinking. Sigils do not need to be designed in this way. Experimentation and creativity is encouraged._

1. Create a quiet, distraction free environment
2. Quiet your mind.
3. Write down your will or desire as a sentence. _("I will be embrace my virtual self")_
4. Strike out all the vowels.
5. Strike out duplicate consonants.
6. Rearrange and play with the letters until you have a new symbol.
7. Activate the sigil.

Discuss options for sigil activation.

### 3D Scanning activation ceremony

Once the group has created their sigils, a volunteer will be 3D scanned to complete the sigil activation process.

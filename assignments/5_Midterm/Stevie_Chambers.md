# I, Too.
Loosely Inspired by : Lygia Clark’s “The Abandonment of Art”

## What is needed:
* 10 guests
* 1 moderator
* 1 trusty recorder (in place of researcher)
* Paper & Black Sharpies
* Sticky Notes for Alter-Ego Name Tags

What happens:
As guests arrive within the first 10 minutes of the event, they are instructed to write out a "personal truth" that has made them feel uncomfortable or embarrassed at some point in their lives. (Ideally, all guests are strangers to one another, but for the sake of presenting in class, we should pretend that this is the case.)

Each guest receives a name tag with the name of their “alter-ego” for the event. - For their protection, guests should not use their real name during this time, however, they can choose to share as much about their lives as they want. Mingling takes place for about 25 minutes.

For the remaining 25 minutes of the event, guests are asked to take a seat and close their eyes. The moderator reads aloud, one at a time, the statements provided by guests upon arrival. As we ask for integrity and sincerity and transparency in this safe and open space, guests should feel at least partly comfortable as they share, by a raise of hands, whether they can relate to what they hear. The number of raised hands is noted by the recorder for results of each statement and in turn, that many number of people are asked to say out loud "I, too". Once each has been read and responded to, everyone opens their eyes. We stand and shake it all off. 

Goal:
Show people that while they may deal with their turmoil or embarrassment or discomfort in solitude, that they are not ever truly alone in whatever that is.

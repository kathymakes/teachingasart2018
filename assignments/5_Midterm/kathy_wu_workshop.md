_(Note: I still need to work out some kinks with my workshop, but the gist is there. [Read the full post here](https://pondermake.tumblr.com/post/171248907089/workshop-you-are-a-forest))_

## workshop: you are a forest

My workshop is inspired by [Lygia Clark’s practice](https://www.moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1422?locale=en#installation-images), and the way she engages bodies, participation, cooperation through simple objects.

In my workshop, I’d like to transmit simple parables from Peter Wohlleben’s book, [The Hidden Life of Trees](https://www.brainpickings.org/2016/09/26/the-hidden-life-of-trees-peter-wohlleben/). Wohlleben describes the ways that seemingly solitary trees protect and talk to one another to create a greater forest.

I would like to focus on the following stories from Hidden Life of Trees:
1.	Old trees make room for new trees to grow
2.	Healthy trees help sick trees with nutrients
3.	Acacia trees warn each other of danger using chemical signals through their leaves
4.	Trees grow branches close and shove for real estate; some eventually make compromises as friends (intermingling roots, living, and even dying together.)

It will be held in the [Brooklyn Botanic Garden](https://www.bbg.org/), which I visited 3 weeks ago.

In my workshop, people are trees. They are connected to a drawing pen in the center of the table by thin ropes, and cannot move left or right. They can only give more slack or tension in the rope.

The pen can represent a number of things here, in the abstract. It might represent energy, or water, or a signal. Through taking rope and letting slack, the forest distributes a resource through a series of drawing exercises.

For example, one person in the forest might be sick, and one person might be healthy, and have a surplus of nutrients. Together, the entire network coordinates to draw a line (representing nutrients) from the healthy person to the sick person.

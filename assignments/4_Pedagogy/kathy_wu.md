## how to boil an egg, by feeling

Last week, I went to visit Michael’s lovely house for our mutual lesson in egg boiling.

I had the idea to make a very familiar, common task suddenly difficult, and unfamiliar:

_"Mmm, tastes like an egg."_

Before trying this experiment, I first did a little reading on how visually impaired people cook. I wondered, Do they cook? is that a very rare thing?

With this assignment, I don’t mean to make a comparison between some blindfolded sighted people and people who are blind or visually impaired– that is a reality they live everyday, that I don’t intend to represent in a single 10 min exercise.

If anything, our experience might feel like a design empathy exercise, at most. What I really wanted to is to invite my partner to experience a very simple task through their body, in new ways. It suddenly becomes awkward, vulnerable, and you suddenly rely on another person for safety and support.

## the experience

Michael and I both thought this was interesting so decided to try both roles.

There are real nuances to navigating a kitchen of heat (and sometimes knives) safely. You really need to trust your partner to take care of you.

You definitely get a renewed relationship with heat.

Two moments that surprised me:

1. Michael said that he smelled the water, as well as heat. Heat to him, smells “comforting,” and “non-acidic” and “all enveloping.” There was a “gas smell, but not a dangerous one.”

2. I could hear the air bubbles forming in the first minute of water heating. Did not expect that at all.

There was a lot more attention to smell, and texture:

> “I can feel a crack in it. I think it means it’s overboiled.”

> “It feels so warm and wet.”

> “That is definitely pepper.”

> “Smells like the kind of egg I like!”

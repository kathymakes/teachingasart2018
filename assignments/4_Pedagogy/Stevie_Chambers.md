# How to Boil an Egg
Inspired by [edited] Syllabus Assignment Content Below

## Week 2
Rapper’s Delight - Recorded hip-hop music in the 80s
In class: We will discuss the first hip-hop record to gain widespread popularity and many of the earliest pioneers, including The Sugarhill Gang, DJ Kool Herc, Grandmaster Flash, Afrika Bambaataa, Kurtis Blow, Doug E. Fresh and others. We all also focus on attentive listening. In Class screening of Krush Groove (1985).

## Homework Assignment:
Use the entire duration of the song Rapper’s Delight by The Sugarhill Gang to Boil an Egg and write a 250-word detailed instructional outline on your process; Read Ch. 4-8 of Soul Babies;

As I would expect to assign the “Boil an Egg” homework early in the week, the idea would be to discuss students’ processes in a Thursday or Friday class period. Following this discussion, I would go on to explain the following:

## Assignment Description (provided Monday/Tuesday):
It takes water about 2 minutes to come to a boil, and between 10-12 minutes for an egg to boil “perfectly”. Use this information, along with the ingredients/materials list below to boil an egg at home. Write a 250-word detailed instructional outline on your process and experience listening to Rapper’s Delight while cooking.

Ingredients/Materials
An uncooked egg
Water
A small pot with lid.
A device for playing song
Link to Rapper’s Delight (provided)


## In Class Discussion (held Thursday/Friday):

The following steps are what I would have recommended for this process.
* Press play on song.
* Fill pot with about a cup and a half of water (enough to cover the egg).
* Bring water to a boil, uncovered. (This should take about two minutes.)
* Remove pot from heat. Add egg and cover for about 10 minutes. (Musical cue starts around the same time as it did for the time it took to boil water. “Everybody go ‘hotel, motel, holiday inn.’”)
* Drain egg and submerge in cold water to cool for remainder of song.
* Peel and enjoy!

Over the course of the 14:45, your eggs should be hard-boiled and ready to eat!

## Discussion questions:
In what order did you boil your egg? What was your process?

What was your experience boiling your egg while listening to the song? Were you able to focus on the lyrics and rhythms in the song?

Did you notice any significant patterns in the cook time and the music?

Would you have done anything differently?

* Notes:
Because Andrew (my partner for this assignment) mentioned contextual configuration, I thought maybe trying to teach “How to Boil an Egg” using sound cues might be an okay way to go, in relation to the course for which I created a syllabus.

* Andrew’s Feedback:
“I really love the idea of using the 10 minutes in a productive way that aligns the lesson with your broader curriculum. It definitely adds an aspect of mindfulness that wasn’t originally there.”

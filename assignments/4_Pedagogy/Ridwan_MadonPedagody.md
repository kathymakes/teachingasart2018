**Synopsis**

What do we do when the appliances and technology of today that you relied on a everyday basis stop working? How can we re-establish our way of living without causing a huge castratophy, or can we? How can we survive with living the basic systems and making the most out of it? This is a cross-disciplinary class which will allow students to explore and understand the different style of forgotten primitive system of living that exists across continents.

At the end of the class, students will have an understanding and develop a better appreciation of different primitive cultures and their way of living while learning the basic primitive systems. The goal of the class is to remove the comfort zone of the students and challenge them mentally on ways of living by having them to demonstrate for the last class on how to boil an egg, the primitive style. 

**Assignments:**
Students are required to be actively involved in weekly mini project, class discussion and group critic. There will be visits to the museum and guests speakers. Students will be will be assigned with weekly readings and videos related to that weeks topic and are required to make reflections through blogging. This is a non examinable course and all grades are assessed weekly.

## Comments from Beverly:

_The idea of looking at primitive cooking is interesting, perhaps I could look into inculcating past cultures. The flow of the structure might be too broad for the beginning, it could narrow down with just the egg, i.e: Egg cooking in primitive days. I can consider the role of an egg in different cultures, how are they served? Cuisine is always interesting, is there different methods of presenting it from different cultures? This could also be a segway to a culture course._

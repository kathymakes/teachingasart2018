For this assignment Sam and I actually boiled some eggs together, each with our own approach to teaching the other.  It was an interesting experience because our methods were different, yet we arrived at the same end goal together.  

How to Boil an Egg

**Syllabus:**

**Course Description:**  This class session will be a hands on workshop where each student will boil an egg.

**Homework:**  Review the instructions below and repeat this process for 1 egg, 3 eggs, and 6 eggs.  How do the cooking times vary and how does the experience differ between them?  Are eggs more likely to crack if there are other eggs bumping into them?  How might you prevent this?  Document your trials and write a paragraph on your responses.

1.  Take a drinking cup and fill it with water; place the egg inside of it.  If it floats to the top, then it means it has spoiled.  Repeat with another egg until finding a ‘healthy’ one. 
2.  Place the egg(s) in a saucepan, and fill with cool water until the level is ~1” above the egg(s).  
3.  Place the pot on the stovetop and turn on the flame to high.  Do not cover it.  
4.  Allow the water to come to a full boil.  
5.  Once the water has reached a rolling boil, turn the flame off, and set a time for 15 minutes.
6.  While waiting for the timer to go off, fill a bowl with water and ice cubes.
7. After the 15 minutes have passed, remove the egg(s) from the pot using a spoon, and place inside of the ice bath for 2 minutes.  
8.  Remove the egg(s) from the cold water and place on a paper towel on a hard surface. 
9.  Gently tap the egg on the countertop until it cracks.  Repeat on all sides of the egg. 
10.  Roll the egg along the surface, causing the cracks to become larger.  
11.  Pick up the egg and manually remove the shell using your fingertips, placing it on the papertowel 
12.  Once complete, rinse the off the egg to remove any excess shell. 
13.  Enjoy the egg. 
14.  Wash the pot, dispose of the shell/paper towel, and wipe down any surfaces that you used.

Feedback:  Sam’s eggs came out great, however one piece of feedback he offered was to try to reduce the time of the cooking.  Perhaps by starting with a pot full of warm/hot water, it would reduce the time it takes to reach a full boil.

## Lecture

Eggs have a few main components...

- yolk
- white
- shell

We will be cooking via heated water bath.

- Water maximum temp is about 100C

Egg white sets at a higher temp than yolk.

- white sets at ~80C
- yolk sets at 70C

This is convenient because we are heating from the outside, inward.

10 minutes is about the correct length of time to...

- maintain temperature difference between yolk and white
- cook yolk to fully set without going above 80C (off smells and color)
- fully cook whites

## Lab

```
How to Hard Boil an Egg

- Place uncooked eggs in a pot.
- Add water until eggs are submerged under the water
- Bring the pot to a full boil, uncovered
- Remove pot from heat and cover for 10-12 minutes
- Drain eggs and submerge in cold water
- Peel and enjoy!
```

Possible confounding factors...

- initial egg temperature
- initial water temperature
- elevation
- egg age

take a picture of your egg

## Homework

Go home and hard boil an egg at home. Compare results to those from class.

- Did your egg cook differently?
- How were your initial conditions at home different?
- Why or why didn't your egg cook the same?

## Feedback from Stevie

Good explanation of how an egg cooks.
Illustration was helpful.
Homework sounds like a good idea.

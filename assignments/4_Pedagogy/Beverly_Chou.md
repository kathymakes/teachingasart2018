### Feedback and Notes from Ridwan
* Too much preparation and focus on cleaning in the beginning especially
* Thinking about other items you could use alongside the microwave to accomplish this task
* There should be an experimental aspect - how many eggs could you microwave at once?

I agree that my plan for the lesson was a little procedural and didn't contain that many unexpected elements. We also talked about ways that boiling eggs can be a metaphor and tie the lesson to other topics.

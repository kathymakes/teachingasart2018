The workshop will be organised in conjunction with the exhibition of Anni Albers: Stay Connected [ 1899 - 1994 ]. Common Objects is a participatory environment at the intersection of education, design, and art that aims to foster our evolving relationships with nature, experimental handcrafts and everyday objects through community interactions and creative play. It will be held at Textile Factory 17, situated at the banks of the Hudson River. The workshop consist series of drop-in activities and ongoing projects for audience of all ages that integrates components such as experimental tactile textile or jewellery/accessory making. Visitors will be engaged in creating and producing works using common objects, visitors will not just create art for art but, finding new ways of thinking with traditional methods used by Anni Albers and in this process, making new social relationships. 

The workshop intend to explore the correlation between traditional methods, form & material. Visitors will have a choice to participate in either experimental textile making or jewellery/accessory making. They will be given a whole assortment of familiar objects for creation which will challenge the whole notion of traditional making. The workshop will allow the visitors to be in the sphere of thinking in terms of material and process of its making. In an inventive response to this, visitor will play a role in creative invention and the importance of craft and handmade objects.  

**The Workshop at ITP, Teaching as Art module**
_Intertwine_ 

_This activity requires handling the clothing Iron, if you are not comfortable with handling low heat, please refrain from participating_

In this workshop, volunteers will be presented with strips of plastics in variant colours. They are required to follow the concept of weaving using Annie Albers method. However, instead of using the traditional object to weave, we will be using strips of plastics to add to the challenge and follow suit Annie's experimental value with her works. 

Due to time constraint and also materials, we will have two volunteers to play out the workshop. Presented infront of them will be four coloured strips of plastics, scissors, a clothing iron and two pieces of paper. A set of instructions will be given to each participant to guide them through the process. 

At the end of the workshop, volunteers will gain an insight on Annie Alber's method of weaving while exploring the use of  common objects as a medium to create interesting creative pieces.

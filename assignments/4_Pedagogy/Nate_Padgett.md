# How to Boil an Egg

I tend to like exploring the why of things in addition to the how. In the case of this assignment, I thought it would be interesting to investigate why eggs become hardboiled, ie: the chemistry at the heart of an egg's transformation from unappealing goop to tasty protein snack. 

### Pedagogy

We investigate the mechanics of processes that are thought of as commonplace and document what is occurring in those processes to gain a deeper understanding of systems that shape our world.

### Syllabus

The class is structured around 6 -7 steps with explanations of the chemistry and biology that occur during those steps:

1. Intro to eggs and natural state
2. Water and heat
3. Boiling the water 
4. Add the egg/denaturation
5. Lower heat and let sit for 10 minutes
6a. Serving hot and hyrodgen sulfide
6b. Serving cold

I made a slideshow to teach my lesson, which gave me a platform for creating (what I hoped would be) a narrative about what is really going on in an egg when it is hardboiled. I used emojis and simple images to make the presentation engaging and kid friendly. The presentation was called **Boiling an egg: What's happening?**

Here's a revised version of the presentation after getting feedback from my partner:

[![Boiling And Egg: What's Happening Presentation](https://github.com/NatePadgett/teachingasart2018/blob/master/assignments/4_Pedagogy/img/Boiling_an_egg.png)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRi1CYD-tNaUqkF7VJJNwX1M56I02dIyo3nK3n6e3lMK_pUCy_ZRF-weV56QU8QWntuk0cG-11G4vaJ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

My wonderful partner Nathier had some great feedback about my lesson. **Most salient was the need to fold more of the science into the active cooking steps**. In my initial presentation I had included a lot of information about the protein content of eggs, why it is important to drop them into the water directly from the fridge, and the role of salt or vinegar in the cooking process, all before step one. Nathier pointed out that in Latin America and Europe, no one refrigerates their eggs, so the first step is highly subjective. She also noted that she has been explicately told not to salt the water used to boil and egg. So I removed those sections. 

In general, a key critique of my lesson was the amount of information, which despite my best intentions could make it difficult to teach a child about boiling an egg using my syllabus. 

Here's a quick video of me going through a couple of the slides, highlighting the importance of an egg's protein content to the process of hardboiing.

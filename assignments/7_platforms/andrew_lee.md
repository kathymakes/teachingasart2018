My strategy in my professional life is generally to discuss diversity issues with people below me, but not talk about it with people above me. I've found managers are rarely taught to listen and have rarely found allies there. Instead, I aim to change via hiring, mentoring, and inclusion. Providing access to a safe place to fail, learn, grow, and get paid.

Much of disability is cultural. It is very difficult to directly confront someone and successfully overturn their enculturation. It is difficult to do in yourself, even with a practice of attempting mindfulness. Cultural change cannot be won, it must be taught in the same manner as all enculturation, by the people around you. So, to change what you are being taught or what is being taught to others, it is important to seek out those who have been previously withheld and invite them in.

The units of cultural are people. You are a person. Providing access is a personal responsibility.

I justify my hiring decisions that I think I'm playing hiring moneyball since I am often hiring individuals for potential over past performance and that don't match the dominant patterns to entering the profession. I don't really consider this action-without-speaking style to be subversive since I believe it is good for those above me as well as those I bring in.

It is also important to continue to progress access once inside an organization. Just because someone is there, doesn't mean they are included. It is everyone's responsibility to connect people together, acknowledge their contributions, and champion their ability.

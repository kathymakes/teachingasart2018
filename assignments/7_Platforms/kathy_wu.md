# thoughts on tongues

This week’s primary readings were spacious, lyrical, moving. I read the optional ones, too, but I'd like to talk about those another time.

The letters & stories feel very different from other materials you read on a day-to-day basis. They’re made of a softer something, like poetry.

I’ve been obsessed with this [Ursula LeGuin speech](https://serendip.brynmawr.edu/sci_cult/leguin/) for the last two or so years. I want to share this quote, which the [Nasrin Himade piece](http://contemptorary.org/for-many-returns/) reminded me of.

LeGuin:
> “…[to] a group of us, women, who were beginning to quarrel over theories in abstract, objective language - and I with my splendid Eastern-women's-college training in the father tongue was in the thick of the fight and going for the kill - to us, Pauline, who is sparing with words, said after clearing her throat, "Offer your experience as your truth." There was a short silence. 

> When we started talking again, we didn't talk objectively, and we didn't fight. We went back to feeling our way into ideas, using the whole intellect not half of it, talking with one another, which involves listening. We tried to offer our experience to one another. Not claiming something: offering something.”

We live in a world where games to achieve power is played in LeGuin’s so-called Father’s Tongue— an masculine language of objectivity, which values debate, metrics, transaction, duality. It governs systems of power and rules domestic dialects, women’s dialects, laypeople’s language as inferior.

The Father tongue asks you to stake claims over land, space, ideas; fight to the death!

What does it mean for a woman of color to succeed in this space, which was not made for her, nor by anyone like her?

In these readings, there is an urgency to protect memory, to hold space for breathing & being in suffocating, sick industries. 

We are working with what we have. It is like refashioning the limits of English—which was not my mother’s mother tongue, either—into a tool which does not colonize so much.

> “To have many returns?” No, but not “to have,” rather “for.”

We can re-orient the tools we have to offer instead of to claim; to share in a more embodied way. To me, true art is made in a Mother Tongue, even if the art world operates on Father Tongue.
 
Words of [Jessica Lynne](http://arts.black/2017/04/a-letter-from-an-arts-worker-jessica-lynne/):
> So when you ask me where we go next, I will tell you that we should go where we are loved. We go where there is a respect for our entire being, for the histories and spirits that enter with us as we enter into a place. We go where there is an insistence on recognizing that art helps us map our pasts, presents, and futures.

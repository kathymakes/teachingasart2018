In the readings for this week, there was a thread of space and making sense of where we should be. There were many moments that I felt like I resonated with the writers despite not being able to fully understand their experiences.

I thought there was a connection between DéLana's airlock metaphor and the quote from Shadia Shirazi:

"But I am very much thinking about who are the people around me, how do I speak to the people around me, how am I listening to the people around me, who am I working with, who am I making possibilities for, who am I allowing to work with me, who am I going to give work that I might refuse in order to give it to someone else… "

I think these are the questions we would start to ask when making room for people to create/expand/connect/merge their airlock spaces. I wish I had a sanctuary and space to have similar conversations when I first started working, and I find DéLana and Jess's letters to each other really heartening.

I found it really interesting when Nasrin writes about imagining the life of her grandmother as Nasrin needs her to be. I sometimes find myself thinking about this as well. I don't know a lot about my family's history beyond my parent's struggles coming to the US. The rest seems to be pretty hush hush, and reading "For Many Returns" makes me sad in way that I don't think I can even imagine more than a superficial idea of what my grandparents might've experienced.

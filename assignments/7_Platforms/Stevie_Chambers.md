Dear DéLana and Jessica,

Thank you for your letters. As a young, black woman now constantly in the spaces you’ve both found yourselves flying away from some time ago, I feel that your words to one another are honest and extremely relatable. So relatable, in fact, that I can vividly imagine these conversations being conducted between my own sister-girls, mentors and mentees.

While I still find myself in predominantly white spaces more often than not, I try hard, everyday, to not allow myself to feel discomfort. Why? Well because I know that I am where I am supposed to be right now, and I know that I can change my scenery (in one way or another) when the times comes. My current setting is not permanent.

At ITP, I often look around and sort of feel like a Dean Thomas parallel - the one and only cool black Gryffindor with a few relevant lines over the course of his several years at Hogwarts. This is not a bad thing, per sa. Dean was, as I said, pretty cool. Memorable enough, but possibly because he was the only black kid with any lines in all 8 films.

I appreciated his role and I LOVE the Harry Potter Franchise in all its parts, but sometimes wished to see more people who looked like me in the films. This is more common than I wish it were.

As one of very few black faces implanted on the 4th fl of the Tisch Building this year, it feels to me as though I have a duty to leave my mark here - be memorable for reasons beyond the fact that I will be 1 out of the 5 black ITPers to graduate in 2019.

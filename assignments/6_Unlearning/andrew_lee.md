In response to [Cultural Appropriation Roundtable Artforum](https://blogs.brown.edu/hiaa-1810-s01-fall-2017/files/2017/08/CULTURAL-APPROPRIATION-A-ROUNDTABLE-artforum.com-in-print.pdf).


I do not consider myself a part of the Art world and I am not very familiar with its dynamics. I am much more familiar with the media industry and I find it a useful way in which to try to understand the Art world.

The media industry is generally about collecting and selling attention. Although whether a company is a media company is often a subject of debate, the attention economy has been running smoothly for many decades, mostly revolving around advertising.

Early in the discussion, an observation was made that cultural appropriation does not seem harmful until it reaches a certain scale or level of success.

It seems to me that thinking about Art as being similar to the media industry can help explain why success makes cultural appropriation seem worse. The main idea that seems to add to the conversation is that attention is a scarce resource.

Since popular works garner more attention, less attention can be paid to other work. If an artist appropriates another culture for their own benefit, the members of the originating culture have less of a chance to be represented.

Additionally, there are several different market segments for attention, aka audiences. If a particular party is in a position of power and uses cultural appropriation to maintain their position, the members of the originating culture have little chance in making inroads to new audiences. The effect is particularly strong when the originating culture is a minority group with a small audience to begin with.

# Reflections on Unlearning

This weeks readings were so rich that I found myself struggling to pick just one to write about. Because I have 
been thinking about inclusion and accessibility a lot lately, I'm going to focus this response on Chitra Ganesh's 
[Unpresidented Times](https://www.artforum.com/slant/chitra-ganesh-on-the-election-65829) piece for Artforum.

In Unpresidented Times, Chitra Ganesh critiques the artworld's embrace of liberal resistance in the wake of the 2016 election.
By doing so, she cast light on the hypocrysy of the mostly white, mostly male "creative elite" that dominate art culture. 
Towards the end of her piece, she urges the reader to pay attention to who is in the room at the next art world event they 
attend: how many brown people are in the room? Is anyone disabled? Are queer artists in attendance? Together these questions 
act as a giant, metaphorical mirrors for critically looking at the art world as a power structure that reinforces inequity. Her 
point is that regardless of the art community's progressive proclivities, the hierarchies it was built around make it 
complicite in creating a culture just as devoid of diversity and diversity of thought as other industries.

I’ve found myself applying this same critical lense to my own industry and interest: technology and technology 
education. I’m not unique in this: the tech sector has received a lot of criticism over the past 5-10 years for not fostering 
enough diversity. And yet, I still see a lack of progress beyond shallow diversity proclamations by the biggest tech companies. 
Products are still largely built and marketed with a white audience in mind and startups still mostly hire white men for their 
most important roles. As a white man myself, I am cognizant of the fact that my race and gender have afforded me certain 
privileges that others do not have the fortune to benefit from. But I feel that this position of privilege brings with it 
a responsibility that echo's Chitra's call in her piece: to think critically about these issues and actively work to 
address them.

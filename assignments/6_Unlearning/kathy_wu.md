## unlearning: some thoughts
So many thoughts about these readings! Here's a grab-bag of thoughts:

~~

I agree with [Coco Fusco](https://hyperallergic.com/368290/censorship-not-the-painting-must-go-on-dana-schutzs-image-of-emmett-till/) at a broad level that censorship doesn’t help towards forward movement.

Now that Schultz's piece is at the Whitney— having already consumed so much attention— it might as well stay, and be an object to learn from.

That said— I think there's a difference between censorship and choosing not to elevate something. There are many platforms for audience attention today, and context is everything. 

The idea of responsibility comes to mind. I'm thinking about a quote from [this article about bots](https://www.crummy.com/2013/11/27/0): "...what's "ethical" and what's "allowed" can be very different things."

Appropriating and not appropriating are not binary states: How are you doing something? Why are you doing it? Who promotes the doing? Who feels the doing?

In Allison's class on Friday, we talked about the experimental poet, [Kenneth Goldsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Goldsmith). Influential, and somewhat notorious for acts of appropriating text.

I was in the audience at Brown University in 2015, where Goldsmith performed his most controversial piece— reading out loud, word for word, the autopsy of Michael Brown to a captive audience. 

Although I think Goldsmith's gesture seems more nefarious somehow, it’s easy to compare him with Shultz.

Intent is important. Delivery is important.

Why did Goldsmith need to perform those words through his body— on that stage, at that university— wearing a loud, neon-colored suit?

Not to say that people need to "stay in their lane," so to speak. That feels limiting to allyship, stunting to visibility. But it's how they leave their lane that is important. 

Allison said something to the effect of this:
It would have been pretty different if Goldsmith had instead tweeted about performing the autopsy of Michael Brown.

I think this is really important. I think the Whitney as a publishing platform is in a specific position to influence an audience. Imagine if Dana Schutz had published this online, or asked a single person to view it in private. I think that's what "Cultural Appropriation Round table" was getting at— about how appropriation creates controversy when it is rewarded.

Platform aside, there are other ways to create space for others' trauma, and for an artist to interpret that pain in a genuine, embodied way. I don't think I have a good answer for moving forward.

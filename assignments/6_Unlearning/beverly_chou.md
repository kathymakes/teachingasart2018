#### Response to [Unprecedented Times: Chitra Ganesh](https://www.artforum.com/slant/chitra-ganesh-on-the-election-65829)

It's interesting how Chitra Ganesh calls us to "observe with awareness" those we disagree with. In this case, she is talking about right-wing conservatives, but I'd like to think everyone no matter their views can try to approach people they view as others in this way. There is a tendency for opposing sides to demonize each other, which seems counterproductive on both ends. Whether in the art world or the regular world, I think we can consider whether the act of observing is a form of protest. Can the act of purposeful observation work against erasure?

I do think it is very important to make historically underrepresented voices and narratives more prominent, and I agree with Ganesh's exercise of self-reflection to assess who is represented in the spaces we inhabit and why. An action like this quietly contributes to revolution and helps us understand our roles and identities in the places we live in.



#### Response to [Cultural Appropriation: A Roundtable](https://blogs.brown.edu/hiaa-1810-s01-fall-2017/files/2017/08/CULTURAL-APPROPRIATION-A-ROUNDTABLE-artforum.com-in-print.pdf)

The artists in the roundtable bring up a lot of different facets of appropriation and what might make it problematic. Personally, I think everyone has the right to free speech and can make whatever they want, but they should be wary of who they choose to show their work to. Creators should be aware of how their work might be received and think about what message they are trying to send. Also, I strongly disagree when artists, businesses, or whoever profits off of others' pain. I think this is extremely problematic even beyond the art world.

Overall, the timing, context, and audience is extremely important to how appropriated pieces will be understood. Modern art clearly has a history of appropriating, for instance orientalism and primitivism, and yet it most of the attention and controversy is on contemporary art and media. I agree that a lot of this is driven by access to media via the Internet, but I don't believe we should revoke that access or censor content.
